Went hiking with my roommates Jack, Hannah and Sophie up in Marin Headlands on the weekend.
We started out at the Golden Gate Bridge and ventured all the way to Tennesse Beach. From there we hiked over the hills onto the Costal Trail.
Then we walked down the valley to reach Rodeo Beach. When we arrived it was getting quite dark and we planned to call an uber, but there was no reception.
After a little panic we wandered over to the arts centre where there luckily was a wedding underway.
Thankfully they let us use their WiFi to call a ride and we were home free!",
