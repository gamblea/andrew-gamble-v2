Went hiking up to Vedder Mountain on the Vedder Mountain Ridge Trail. Starting from the trail head it's about a 9km round trip, with an elevation gain of 377m.

Situated in the forest it has good tree coverage and a nice mix of ups and downs. Getting to the trail head
requires driving up a logging road a few kilometers. The trail wasn't too busy and we only saw a few people throughout the entire hike.
